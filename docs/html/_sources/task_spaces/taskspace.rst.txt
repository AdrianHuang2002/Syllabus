Task Spaces
===========

Syllabus provides the TaskSpace class as a way to represent the entire space of classes
that are playable in an environment. This is necessary for sampling tasks from the
entire task space.

This component is currently a work in progress. Future versions will include:

- Mutable Task Spaces

- Train, test, and validation splits over the task space

- Support for more complex task spaces (currently only Discrete, MultiDiscrete, and Box spaces are fully supported)
